# Securely

A runtime security framework for Flutter applications that detects common reverse engineering and tampering environments such as debuggers, rooted devices, emulators, and instrumentation tools (e.g., Frida).

This project focuses on **runtime detection**, not just static obfuscation, making it suitable for security-critical Flutter applications.

## 🚀 Features Overview

### ✅ Implemented (Basic Security Layer)

- **Debugger Detection**
  - Detects if the app is being debugged at runtime.
  - Uses native Android APIs.

- **Root Detection**
  - Detects rooted devices using:
    - `su` binary checks
    - Known root file paths
    - Dangerous system properties

- **Emulator Detection**
  - Detects Android emulators using:
    - Build fingerprints
    - QEMU indicators
    - Generic hardware/device properties

- **Frida (Basic) Detection**
  - Detects common Frida indicators:
    - `frida-server` process
    - Suspicious library names
    - Known Frida strings

## 🧩 Planned (Next Phase)

- **Unified Security Result**
  - Single API call to check all threats at once.
  - Example result:
    ```json
    {
      "debugger": false,
      "rooted": false,
      "emulator": true,
      "frida": false
    }
    ```

- **Simple Response Engine**
  - Basic reactions when a threat is detected:
    - App termination
    - Disable sensitive features
    - Log security events

## 🔧 Usage

### Check individual threats

```dart
bool isRooted = await AntiReverse.isRootDetected();
bool isEmulator = await AntiReverse.isEmulatorDetected();
bool isFrida = await AntiReverse.isFridaDetected();
bool isDebugged = await AntiReverse.isDebuggerDetected();
```
## 🎯 Project Goals
Provide runtime protection for Flutter apps

Make reverse engineering and dynamic analysis harder

Serve as a final-year project / project-based thesis in Cyber Security, Mobile Application Security, Software Engineering

## ⚠️ Limitations
Root and Frida detection are not 100% foolproof

Advanced attackers may bypass checks

This framework focuses on raising the attack cost, not absolute prevention

## 🔮 Future Improvements
Native C/C++ (NDK) based detection

Risk scoring system

Policy-based responses

iOS support

Obfuscation-aware runtime checks
